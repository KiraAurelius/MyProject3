Here are the links for my videos. The first one will be the one with me talking the second one is the one with sounds as proof sounds are implemented, I tried to record one with both but I'm not too good at it and I didn't want to record the video again for the nth time.

Edit: I forgot to put in a game description
The game is a very simple fps game where there will be endless cubes spawning and trying to ram you off the stage. You move with simple WASD and space for jumping and M1 for shooting projectiles to destroy the enemies.
There is a point system where it keeps track of how many cubes you have destroyed, 10 points for each cube.
